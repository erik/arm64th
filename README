A Forth for Apple Silicon bootstrapped from a small kernel written in arm64
assembly. This is a 64 bit, indirect threaded Forth which runs on recent
versions of macOS.

It's "mostly standard", but doesn't implement every common word. Use this if
you're curious how to bootstrap Forth, not if you need a production system.

There are no dependencies, but you'll need the standard Apple development
toolchain (i.e. clang) to build it.

    # build the executable
    make

    # run tests
    make test

    # execute a file
    ./forth demo.f

    # start a REPL from stdin
    ./forth

See `demo.f` for a tiny crash course on Forth and the syntax supported by
this system.


ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

This project is my first experience with Forth and I was helped immensely
by several resources.

  1. Dave Gauer's blog is what nerd sniped me originally into this completely
     unnecessary tangent which ate two months of my life. Sold me on the 1970s
     magic on offer by Forth.

     https://ratfactor.com/forth/the_programming_language_that_writes_itself.html

  2. Jonesforth is a Forth for x86 written in a literate programming style. Very
     helpful when trying to get the machine flying. This was the source of
     several of the fundamental design decisions (such as being indirect
     threaded).

  3. Planckforth builds off of a 1024 byte hand-written binary executable
     defining a tiny set of operations which can peek and poke memory, then
     bootstraps a full Forth environment from effectively nothing. It's very
     cool!
